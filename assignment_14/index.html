		<h3>Time for Change</h3>
		<p>As a sloth, I tried to figure out what it was I wanted to do.  All I knew is it was time for a change.  The funny part, after learning about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) through Common Core State Standards, I was one of the biggest advocates pushing it to be the norm for afterschool programs.</p>
		<p>It didn't dawn on me at the time that Coding, which is a major part of STEM, would also be a great fit for me as well.</p>
		<p>After sitting around completely bored, I had an epiphany.  Since I also thoroughly enjoyed the coding games and activities offered to the students, why shouldn't I learn it as well? Here we are!</p>
