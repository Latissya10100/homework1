		<h1>What is Patois?</h1>
	</div>
	<p id="para1">Patois or Patwah is Jamaican slang. Would you sound really cool if you knew how to speak it? Are you ready to walk into your favorite Jamaican restaurant and ask for that beef pattie using the native language? Or maybe you would like to converse fluently with your Jamaican bredren. Well, you won't be able to do that from here, but we can still have some fun.</p>
	<p id="para2">Let's get started with the top 5 most common terms that you've probably heard before and didn't fully understand. Just to be sure, we've also included sentences to reiterate how to properly use them.  Happy learning!</p>
