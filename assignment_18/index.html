    <h2>Sensai and his Disciples</h2>
      <p class="par">Sensai trains his disciples to be fierce and loyal coders. Many a night is spent perfecting the delicate art of front and back end web development whilst balancing organizational skills. Sensai rules with an iron fist and ensures his troops live by the "DRY" theory. His disciples are somewhere in the Appalachian mountains training to become Javascript ninjas.  I shudder at the thought of how ferocious they will become.  For now, they shall remain anonymous.</p>
